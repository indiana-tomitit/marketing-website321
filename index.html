                <h2>What has happened to Facebook?</h2> <br>
                <p>Facebook has a large impact on how many people interact in their daily lives.
				Facebook's initial intention for its users was connections with friends and family, showing people what is happening in the world and letting user’s share what matters to them.
				We believe facebook has abandoned these initial goals in favour of features that don’t put the users best interest first, such as Intrusive advertising, infinite scrolling and excessive notification to keep users on the site for as long as possible.

				<p>Our main goal is to allow our users to be able to use Facebook in a way that aligns with their goals.
				In order to achieve this we seek to address three key focuses of our plugin:<br><br>  
				
				1.) Increasing productivity <br>
				2.) Emphasise meaningful connections between users<br>
				3.) Foster better internet usage habits<br><br>
				
				We aim to address these issues through: <br><br>
					1.) Blocking content<br>
					2.) Altering incoming content<br>
					3.) Presenting new content<br>
					4.) User controlled customisation<br>

                <h1 class="title"> Our Project Aims & <span>Design Approach</span></h1>
            </div>
            <p>The aim of this project is to provide a solution for current and future Facebook users to be able to view and use Facebook the way they want to use it.
			Facebook in its current state has degraded over the years from its initial goal of connecting people around the world to introducing intrusive advertising,
			infinite scrolling, excessive notifications, news propaganda and lots of links around the webpage to keep its users on the website. <br><br>
			
			To address these problems, we are creating a chrome extension that lets users alter Facebook and it layout by removing sections of Facebook. 
			We will also be modifying sections of Facebook to keep the focus on what the users original intent is when using Facebook.
			Alterations of Facebook include hiding likes from users or editing the newsfeed to be more personalised for the user.<br><br> 
			
			We want our interface for controlling Facebook to be simple and clean, something all users can look at and understand what it is, and how to use it without an explanation.
			For this we will be using Material Design, which is a design approach whose principles focus on flat design, vibrant aesthetics and responsiveness to satisfy our diverse target market.
			With users of Facebook being able to retake control over their social media, we hope to increase their productivity and be in a healthier state of mind.
